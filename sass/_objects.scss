// This is where major page objects get imported.
// Each page object will live under the `sass/objects/` directory (which you'll create)
// This exercise is making the page header and page footer objects, so you'll need to import them:
//
// @import "objects/page-header";
// @import "objects/page-footer";
//
// Remember to include the underscore on the file names, but omit it in the `@import` directive.
// Also you don't have to include the filename extension in the `@import` directive, sass will figure it out.

@import 'site_header';
